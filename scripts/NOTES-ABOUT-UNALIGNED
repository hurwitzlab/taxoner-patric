Since taxoner is stupid (ok, its cool for some things) about unaligned reads
It outputs duplicate unaligned reads in each sam file (e.g. 0.fasta.sam, 1.fasta.sam)

So what we need to do for /taxoner-out/ is:
samtools view -b -f 4 0.fasta.sam > 0.unaligned.bam #and for 1.fasta, etc.
#to get the unaligned reads in bam format then delete the sams
#then
samtools merge -n -@ [cpu_cores] -b [list-of-bams e.g. 0.bam 1.bam] sorted.unaligned.bam
#which merges and SORTS! all those duplicates into unique reads
#then you can delete all that crap in the list-of-bams
#then
bam2fastx -o sorted.ilv.fq sorted.unaligned.bam
#which is from tophat tools, it correctly converts the reads 
#to an interleaved fastq file, ta da!
#no need to search through those original fastqs!

*Also wasting space is the *.aln files... the only file really needs is the
/results/taxonomy.txt for krona tools
