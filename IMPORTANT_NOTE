For the "filtered_fastq" dir

These files are orphaned:
DNA_2_TGACCA_L002_R2_006.fastq.trimmed.clipped
DNA_3_ACAGTG_L002_R2_009.fastq.trimmed.clipped
DNA_3_ACAGTG_L002_R2_010.fastq.trimmed.clipped
DNA_4_GCCAAT_L002_R2_012.fastq.trimmed.clipped
DNA_4_GCCAAT_L002_R2_013.fastq.trimmed.clipped
DNA_4_GCCAAT_L002_R2_014.fastq.trimmed.clipped

The complementary "R1" files were eliminated in the 
QC step because the longest continguous sequence that
had NO bases with a Q < 14 was below 52bp in length)
*See the script qc-fastq.sh in mouse/scripts/workers
of the fizkin pipeline

Because they are orphaned, I'm re-writing them as:
DNA_2_TGACCA_L002_006.nomatch2.fastq

to go along with the mergeShuffledFastq.pl script
