==============

This is to work with taxoner64, a bowtie2 based solution to mapping reads to a metagenome

Github: https://github.com/r78v10a07/taxoner

and with PATRIC, a database of bacterial genomes
https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Genomes

# Patric genomes must be in bowtie2 format
# This is meant to be used on a PBS job scheduling system

# Directions
1. Run the scripts in order, one at a time, in the /scripts dir
